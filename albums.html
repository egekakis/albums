<b>Fun Trick Noisemaker - The Apples in Stereo</b> - Very good album, very easy to listen to<br>
<b>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven - Godspeed You! Black Emperor</b> - Some good sounding things in the weeds of the abstract noise, this album takes itself too seriously, I did not enjoy it, annoyingly difficult to listen to<br>

<b> Grace - Jeff Buckley</b> - This is one of my top albums on this list, a beautiful album<br>
<b> Axis: Bold as Love - Jimi Hendrix</b> - Enjoyed this, Jimi brings a lot of fantstic melodies to this album<br>

<b> uknowhatimsayin&#191 - Danny Brown</b> - I couldn't get into this album, not my favorite listen<br>
<b> Extended Play - Statik Selektah</b> - Statik really takes form on this album, phenomenal display of hip-hop literacy, fantastic beats<br>
<b> Ambivalence Avenue - Bibo</b> - Had one great single, everything else felt lackluster for me, wish the rest of the album sounded more like Jealous of Roses<br>
<b> Olympia 64 - Jaques Brel</b> - Does not need an introduction, one of the best of all time<br>
<b> Dynamo - Soda Stereo</b> - Just alright, had some stuff that took me for a ride, but over all very neutral on this one<br>

<b> Hive Mind - The Internet</b> - Very smooth, very melodically proficient<br>
<b> Bright Size Life - Pat Metheny</b> - Wonderful listen, wonderful album<br>
<b> Punisher - Phoebe Bridgers</b> - I somewhat understand the hype around this album, but I don't think it knocks it out of the park. I think it is a strong decent album, a little confused as to why everyone is obsessed with it<br>
<b> Atrocity Exhibition - Danny Brown</b> - Didn't really enjoy this one at all<br>
<b> A Different Shade of Blue - Knocked Loose</b> - Best Metalcore album to come out in the past 5 years for me<br>
<b> The Bends - Radiohead</b> - I really enjoyed listening to this album, The Bends is a standout from Radiohead's discography<br>

<b> BAD NEIGHBOR - MED</b> - I liked this album so much I bought the instrumental vinyl, very good listen<br>
<b> In On the Kill Taker - Fugazi</b> - This album felt benign to me, not every album from an artist has to have the same energy, but I don't really see the appeal of this one, coming from Repeater by them. I liked a few songs, but the album was just okay<br>
<b> Benji - Sun Kil Moon</b> - This is one of the most intimate pieces of music I've ever heard, I think it is amazing, I really like this album<br>
<b> Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix - Phoenix</b> - Every song on this album is good. This is one of the best albums ever released in my opinion. Some of the best indie-pop music you can listen to<br>
<b> Goo - Sonic Youth</b> - Just okay, felt like Sonic Youth was making this album harder to enjoy on purpose, but still it has a lot of redeeming qualities<br>
<b> Wu-Tang Forever - Wu-Tang Clan</b> - Two of my favorite hip-hop songs are on this album, but other than that, I didn't love it. Fell flat for me, almost a chore to listen to it start to finish<br>

<b> Vaudevill Villain - Viktor Vaughn</b> - Not the biggest fan of this Doom release, but still enjoyed a few songs<br>

<b> Magnolia Electric Co. - Songs:Ohia</b> - Little to fault on this one, really really really great listen<br>
<b> We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service - A Tribe Called Quest</b> - This album doesn't miss, fantastic modern Tribe release, would consider it the best posthumous album out there<br>

<b> Pray For Paris - Westside Gunn</b> - Enjoyed a lot of tracks on this, great release<br>
<b> Everything Else Has Gone Wrong - Bombay Bicycle Club</b> - I liked it, but not even close to previous releases. The ending was good, some beautiful songs on this one.<br>
<b> Ænima - TOOL</b> - A classic, and an extremely good album, hard to think of a better pick in this genre<br>
<b> Red House Painters 1 - Red House Painters</b> - Beautiful collection of music, worth a listen, very very good album<br>
<b> Rage Against the Machine - Rage Against The Machine</b> - Insane album, I love this album, it is SO GOOD<br>

<b> This Old Dog - Mac DeMarco</b> - Loved it, really really loved it<br>
<b> Some Rap Songs - Earl Sweatshirt</b> - I get the album, but I do not really like this album, very disappointing<br>
<b> Doppelganger - The Fall of Troy</b> - One of my favorites of all time. This album is something else, listen to every single song and tell me you didn't get an adrenaline rush, fantastic piece of music, more people need to listen to this album in full<br>
<b> Mezzanine - Massive Attack</b> - Why is this a famous album, I had a hard time enjoying any songs on this, it really missed the mark for me<br>
<b> Long Season - Fishmans</b> - Go listen to this RIGHT NOW, have a moment<br>
<b> ホット・アイランズ - 辛島文雄</b> - Wonderful find, wonderful music, I loved it<br>
<b> Justice - Justice</b> - I think this album is a cut above the rest, really really shines as a French electronic album, hard to ask for anything more from Justice, a must-listen for anyone interested in music<br>
<b> Labcabincalifornia - The Pharcyde</b> - Has this on repeat, one of the best albums, completely captures a genre<br>
<b> The Unseen - Quasimoto</b> - In the running for my favorite album of all time, I couldn't stop listening to this for about a month, not much else to say, give it a listen<br>

<b> Mosaik - Siriusmo</b> - Really wanted more from this album, a little disappointing<br>
<b> Transa - Caetano Veloso</b> - Fantastic album, start to finish<br>
<b> Stratosphere - Duster</b> - You are untethered in space when listening to this album, it might not be for everyone, but it left an incredible mark on me<br>
<b> Veteran - JPEGMAFIA</b> - Contender for best hip-hop album of the 2010s, Peggy knocks this album out of the park, this is a must listen, you'd be hard pressed to find an album that hits you the way Veteran does<br>
<b> Oi Oi Oi - Boys Noize</b> - Cut out an hour of your day and listen to this album, it is not for everyone, but for those who it <i> is </i> for, it'a some of the most enjoyable electronic music out there<br>
<b> Aqualung - Jethro Tull</b> - Boring, I really didn't like this one at all<br>
<b> Discovery - Daft Punk</b> - It really really really really really doesn't get much better than this, listen to Discovery, it is so good<br>
<b> Enter The Wu-Tang(36 Chambers) - Wu-Tang Clan</b> - One of those classic albums that people talk about all the time, but honestly deserves the hype, this is a fantastic listen<br>
<b> Yessir Whatever - Quasimoto</b> - It's a good album, but it's just not even close to The Unseen, if you want to get into Quasimoto, listen to this album before you listen to The Unseen<br>
<b> Lamb Over Rice - Action Bronson</b> - Surprised this isn't a more talked about album when mentioning Action Bronson, this is really one of his best collections of songs<br>
<b> Dark Lane Demo Tapes - Drake</b> - When it hits it HITS, when it misses, it misses, a very 50% enjoyment level album<br>

<b> Whateva, Vol. 3 - Cookin Soul</b> - Lots of cool beats on this one, enjoyed it, a nice mixup from my usual hip-hop taste<br>
<b> Metaphorical Music - Nujabes</b> - If you look past some of the basic hip hop bars, you'll find some of the best instrumentals you've ever heard. This album is incredible, some of the sounds Nujabes puts out on this record will give you goosebumps<br>
<b> Shades of Blue - Madlib</b> - Very, very good instrumental album, some fantastic beats and melodies on here, loved it<br>
<b> Modal Soul - Nujabes</b> - I enjoyed this album, but not my favorite listen by Nujabes, expected a bit more, but even still it was very relaxing and an easy listen<br>
<b> Ancestors of Sound - Madlib</b> - Not sure this album was for me, two or three standout tracks, but some of the songs I ended up just not understanding/enjoying<br>

<b> Cavalcade - black midi</b> - This album was gorgeous, I really enjoyed it, I thought it was great<br>

<b> UNLOCKED 1.5 - Denzel Curry</b> - THIS is how you do an album remix, really great stuff<br>

<b> LULU - Conway the Machine</b> - Pretty good, not particularly memorable, but at least one or two strong singles I enjoyed<br>
<b> BUBBA - KAYTRANADA</b> - This was a great album, lots of catchy songs, really love to hear what KAYTRANADA is putting out<br>
